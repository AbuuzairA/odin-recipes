    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray
        </li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder
        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sea salt
        </li>
        <li>½ cup butter, cut into chunks
            ¾ cup semisweet chocolate chips
⅔ cup brown sugar
½ cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon sea salt, or as needed
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper and spray with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon sea salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Place butter in a saucepan over low heat and cook until melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chocolate chips and stir until completely melted. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, white sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Pour a small amount of the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and stir until well combined. Slowly add remaining chocolate mixture, stirring constantly so the eggs don't curdle. Fold in the flour mixture until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Drop 6 large scoops of batter about 2 inches apart onto each of the prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>To serve, drizzle salmon with extra sauce and sprinkle green onion over top.</li>
    </ol>
